#### PHP Development
Requires a Modit Core running to get api and other dependencies. Can use https://mod.it
Optional API_HOST can be set. If it is not all api calls will route through /mock
```
  CORE_HOST=https://mod.it php -S localhost:8000 router.php
```
#### Recommended Less Compilation

```
  $ npm install -g less
  $ ./less.sh
```
